- Automate (research, scrape, ...) using navigation, form-filling, print to PDF
- Log using screenshots, console logs, HAR traces
- Refactor: remove dead code
- Replay test/automation scripts: capture flow as scripts
- Monitor performance, audit using Lighthouse, accessibility with axe-core
- Emulate devices, screen size, dark mode, network speed, geo, time zone
- Harden via cookie audits, pen-testing
- Parallelize using multiple tabs
- Browse safely using separate profiles / incognito mode
