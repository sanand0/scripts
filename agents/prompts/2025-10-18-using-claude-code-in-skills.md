> Create only an "evaluation.md" that answers these questions:
>
> 1. Read Claude's skill spec at https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview.
>    Do the skills in this tree align with the spec? What are the good points of alignment and what are deviations?
>
> 2. I want AGENTS.md to be manually editable but should have a section that lists the skills like this:
>
>    ```markdown
>    Consult this index and open the relevant SKILL.md under /home/sanand/code/scripts/agents/ under when needed:
>
>    - [Coding](code/SKILL.md): Python / JavaScript coding style guide
>    - [npm package style guide](npm-packages/SKILL.md): Conventions for package.json, README.md, coding & testing styles
>    - [Vitest + DOM testing](vitest-dom/SKILL.md): Fast, lightweight testing for front-end apps. Uses vitest + jsdom instead to avoid heavy playwright.
>    ```
>
>    This section should be automatically generated from the **/SKILL.md in this directory by a simple script.
>    The rest of AGENTS.md must be manually editable, so we need delimiters/markers in AGENTS.md within which this content will be inserted.
>    The delimiters/markers should not take up too many tokens. They should not be jarring or confusing to a reader or coding agents.
>
>    What language should I for minimal dependency, speed, small readable code? bash, Python or JS (Node/Deno)?
>    Share a sample script in your chosen language (write it inside the same evaluation.md) and explain your design decisions.
>
> 3. There are external public repos like https://github.com/anthropics/skills that contain skills in folders.
>    Ideally, I would like to pick and choose folders from such repos and download them into this folder.
>    How can I do that with a simple bash script using git or gh to download specific folders?
>    How can I keep them fresh, i.e. rewrite with the same content but updated, by re-running the script?

- **Gaps to close:** Descriptions such as `Python / JavaScript coding style guide` or `Conventions for package.json…` explain _what_ the skill covers but not explicitly _when Claude should use it_. The spec calls for the description to combine both, so add a short trigger clause (e.g., “Use this when editing Python or JavaScript code in this repo.”).
- **Missing headline context:** The spec’s template shows a leading `# Skill Name` heading and asks for concrete usage examples. None of the current skills add that heading or examples, making it harder for Claude to anchor context once the body is loaded. Adding the heading and one or two copy-pasteable scenarios will improve recall.
- **Ambiguous directives:** Lines such as “Name intermediates?” in `code/SKILL.md` read like open questions. Converting these into explicit instructions (“Name intermediate variables descriptively”) keeps the guidance unambiguous for the agent.
- **Environment notes:** The spec highlights that Claude’s execution container lacks network access and runtime package installs. Skills that suggest CDN imports or installing tools (`npm`, CDN import maps) should mention the container’s limits or scope them to offline code authoring to avoid conflict with runtime constraints.

Skill Index Automation Strategy

- **Language choice:** Use Python. It is preinstalled, runs quickly, and the standard library (pathlib, textwrap, operator) is enough to parse frontmatter without extra dependencies. Bash would need fragile text parsing; Node/Deno would add dependency and startup overhead.
- **Markers:** Embed a compact HTML comment pair (`<!-- skill-index:start -->` / `<!-- skill-index:end -->`) in `AGENTS.md`. These are short, unobtrusive, and easy for both humans and scripts to locate.
- **Behaviour:** The script scans `*/SKILL.md` and `*/*/SKILL.md` under the current directory, extracts `name` and `description`, formats bullets like the sample, and rewrites only the block between the markers—leaving the rest of `AGENTS.md` manually editable.

Importing Skill Folders From External Repos

- **Sparse clone workflow:** Use Git’s sparse checkout to pull only the directories you want, then sync them into the local skills tree. This avoids downloading an entire large repository and re-running the script keeps folders up to date.
- Re-running the script wipes each destination directory (`rsync --delete`) and replaces it with the latest contents, keeping the local copy fresh without manual cleanup. If you prefer GitHub CLI, swap the `git clone` stanza with `gh repo clone -- --filter=blob:none --sparse`, keeping the same sparse checkout and sync steps.

> Create an `agents_gen.py` based on your code but:
>
> - Use `<!-- skills -->` and `<!-- /skills -->` as delimiters
> - Reduce lines of code while maintaining readability. Drop error handling (let things fail).
>
> Create `skills_gen.sh` but modify so that we can clone from multiple repos and from multiple folders within each repo.
> Ideally, we should be able to specify these directly by listing the URLs one below the other and the script does the rest - including grouping for efficiency. Keep the script VERY readable.

> Run both and test

---

> I would like **my** skills to be committed but not the cloned skills.
> What are the most minimal, elegant, maintainable approaches for this?
>
> One option is to prefix or suffix with an innocuous file-system-safe special character (perhaps Unicode) that we can .gitignore.
> Another option is to modify `skills_gen.sh` to add a `.gitignore` in each folder.
> There may be other elegant ones. List them.
> Then recommend one.

- Place external folders under a single parent directory and ignore that parent in .gitignore. It needs only one rule, scales as you add folders, keeps your own
  skills tracked, and is obvious to future maintainers.

---

> Does Claude Skills work with second-level directories?

No.

---

> Revise your options and recommend one. Also, if I did use a single-character suffix / prefix (special-character or unicode), recommend options for that.

- Commit a root .gitignore block that lists each imported directory (/brainstorming/, /changelog-generator/, …). Let skills_gen.sh refresh
- Prefix options: tilde ~, at-sign @, or middle dot · if you want to stand out without being visually harsh.

---

› Would skills_gen.sh be more concise if we wrote it in Python?

> Probably not.

---

> Update `agents_gen.py` to include the logic in `skills_gen.sh`.
> Add a prefix `-` before each directory locally, e.g. `-skill-creator`.
> Add a .gitignore to ignore any files beginning with `-`.

---

> Update `agents_gen.py` with a file-level docstring clearly explaining step-by-step what it does, how, and the outcome.
> Run and test.

---

> Update `agents_gen.py` minimally to refresh remote skills only if they are more than 1 day old.

---

> Eliminate the `-` prefix entirely. Instead, maintain a .gitignore that lists the remote skills.
