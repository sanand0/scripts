Analyze the data systematically for insights as follows:

1. **About the data**. Identify dimensions & measures, types, granularity, ranges, completeness, distribution, trends. List extractable features/metadata, derived metrics, ...
2. **What matters**. List audiences, problems that matter, and what's actionable
3. **What stands out**. Analyze extreme/unexpected distributions, breaks in patterns, surprising correlations, ...
4. **Segments**. Cluster/classify/segment. Find unusual, extreme, high-variance groups, ...
5. **Actions**. Hypothesize small changes yielding big effects. Look for underutilization, phase transitions, tipping points, ...
6. **Surprises**. List insights that would surprise domain experts, contradicting assumptions, revealing hidden patterns in space, time, or interactions, ...
7. **Checks**. Check for errors/bias using provenance, definitions, methodology, control for confounders, uncertainty, base rates, triangulation (via The Data Detective).

Synthesize the findings with confidence, evidence (data, quotes), impact (effect size, base rate), what's surprising, actions, confounders.

Prioritize by high-impact (not incremental), actionable (not impractical), surprising (not obvious), specific (not generic) insights.

Summarize into a 5-liner for the audience with the top 3 insights, impact and actions.

Save the analysis as a markdown report with any required charts, tables, code snippets, or references.
