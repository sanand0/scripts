description: How to plan & break down large, complex tasks
---

Begin by writing a `PLAN.md` breaking down the task into numbered atomic steps (1-2 sentences) with the goal, checklist, and instructions.

You don't need to complete all steps at one shot. Sub-agents can start from where you left off.

After each step, update `PLAN.md` with actions & outcomes - context for another agent to continue.

Use sub-agents to execute the work to save context.
Delegate planning to better models (new, more thinking).
